# Summative-2_Negpod_17
## Project overview 
For the Bachelor of Software Engineering Cohort, this project is a Shell-based Application designed to handle student records.
## Description 
This program has features that help you create student records, save records to a file, see all students, delete students by I.D., and update student data.
## Task
Records for students can be created, viewed, updated, and deleted.
Keep student information in a file called students-list_0923.txt.
Choose a few students' emails, then save them to a different file (student-emails.txt).
The move-to-directory. sh script allows you to automatically transfer project files to a specified directory (negpod_id-q1).
Backup-Negpod_ID.sh may be used to create backups of the project directory to a remote server (/summative/0923-2023S).
## File structure 
The primary registration script is called main.sh.
File to hold student records: students-list_0923.txt.
Script for choosing student emails: select-emails.sh.
student-emails.txt is a file used to save particular student emails.
Automate file moving using the move-to-directory.sh script.
Negpod_id-Q1: Project file shifting directory.
Negpod backup script (backup-Negpod_ID.sh) for remote server backup.

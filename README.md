# summative-2_Negpod_17
## project overview 
For the Bachelor of Software Engineering Cohort, this project is a Shell-based Application designed to handle student records.
## description 
This program has features that help you create student records, save records to a file, see all students, delete students by I.D., and update student data.
## task
Records for students can be created, viewed, updated, and deleted.
Keep student information in a file called students-list_0923.txt.
Choose a few students' emails, then save them to a different file (student-emails.txt).
The move-to-directory. sh script allows you to automatically transfer project files to a specified directory (negpod_id-q1).
Backup-Negpod_ID.sh may be used to create backups of the project directory to a remote server (/summative/0923-2023S).
